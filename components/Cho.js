            <p className='para-1'>Yo! Cho's kitchen strives to 
                source local, sustainable and organic when possible.
                We work hard to source premium ingredients and we cook
                everything from scratch with love. We also do our best to 
                pay our employees living wages and to reduce our environental 
                footprint wherever we can. Overall this factors translate to higher 
                menu prices, but we hope that you find value and feel a sense of comfort
                in knowing that we can aim to get better everyday at doing what is 
                important to us.
